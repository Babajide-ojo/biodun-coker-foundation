                Biodun Coker (FCCA, AFA) was born in the vibrant Oluwole,
                Olowogbowo area of Lagos Island, growing up in a politically
                active environment thanks to his father, Alhaji Abdulbaqee
                Yemisi Coker, a dedicated grassroots politician. Their family
                home on Wilson Lane was a central hub for political meetings,
                where he and his siblings managed logistics, from setting up
                seats to handling media and refreshments.
                <br></br>
                During General Sanni Abacha&#39;s transition from military to
                civilian rule, their home witnessed the covert formation of five
                political parties. This significant period profoundly influenced
                his early political insights and laid the groundwork for his
                future endeavors in politics.
                <br></br>
                Today, Biodun Coker is a vision-driven Nigerian, constantly
                seizing opportunities to serve communities and make a positive
                impact on lives.

                Biodun&#39;s educational journey reflects his commitment to
                academic excellence and intellectual growth. After completing
                his secondary education, he pursued a Bachelor of Science in
                Economics at Lagos State University, where he laid a solid
                foundation in economic principles. Driven by a desire to expand
                his expertise, he then achieved a second Bachelor of Science
                degree in Applied Accounting from Oxford Brookes University.
                This dual academic background in economics and accounting
                highlights his dedication to both theoretical and practical
